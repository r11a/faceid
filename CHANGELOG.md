# Changelog

All notable changes to FaceID. The Home Assistant app shows this file in the
update dialog; standalone users can watch GitHub releases.

## 5.1.1 — 2026-08-11

- **Direct route navigation:** every camera bubble in the visit clip player is now a
  real touch-friendly button. Selecting it immediately stops the current clip and
  loads that exact recognition event.
- **Clear playlist state:** the active clip, fully played clips and missing Frigate
  recordings have distinct accessible states. After playback ends, the bubbles remain
  available for instant replay or investigation in any order.

## 5.1.0 — 2026-08-11

- **Temporary Guest Access:** create a guest from one quality-checked photo, limit
  recognition to a date/time window, selected cameras and an entry count, then revoke
  or delete it immediately from a friendly UI. Guest matching uses a stricter score and
  margin; liveness plus a second factor are mandatory and FaceID never unlocks alone.
- **Site map and estimated routes:** drag cameras onto a responsive site canvas, connect
  plausible transitions and see each person's last observed camera. Saved links also
  constrain live scenario and appearance-ReID paths; the UI clearly labels locations as
  estimates rather than GPS positions.
- **Anonymous traffic analytics:** camera/zone traffic share, peak hour and common
  transitions are calculated from Frigate person events without using identities or
  face images in the aggregate calculations.
- **Route clip playlist:** every visit can play its Frigate recognition clips in
  chronological camera order. The player shows route progress, advances automatically
  and skips expired/missing clips without stopping the remaining journey.
- **Operational backup:** guest templates, guest audit decisions and the site map are
  included in safe backups and restores.

## 5.0.4 — 2026-08-11

- **Camera participation from the UI:** every Frigate camera can now be enabled or
  paused directly from Camera Studio. All cameras remain enabled by default.
- **Complete pause behavior:** a paused camera is excluded from live MQTT events,
  polling, queued recognition jobs and history backfill; its stale presence state is
  cleared immediately. Manual frame inspection remains available for setup.
- **Clear operational feedback:** camera cards show active/paused status, totals and
  an “enable all” action, with confirmation after every change.
- **Persisted and compatible:** selections survive restarts, while the legacy YAML
  camera allow-list remains a fallback until an explicit UI selection is saved.

## 5.0.3 — 2026-08-11

- **Face-size control in Liveness:** every camera card now has a 24–240px visual
  threshold slider. Saving updates both daytime and nighttime minimum face size
  together with the liveness policy.
- **Explicit Intercom selection:** the Intercom screen starts with a prominent camera
  picker containing every Frigate camera and remembers the last selected camera.
- **Clear camera role:** a normal-user toggle marks or unmarks the selected camera as
  an Intercom camera. Multiple Intercom cameras remain supported and visibly labelled.

## 5.0.2 — 2026-08-11

- **Visual liveness test:** the exact frame used by the test is shown with a
  responsive face outline, detected face size in pixels and the configured minimum.
- **Useful feedback:** separate, plain-language cards show liveness confidence,
  sharpness and lighting, followed by concrete advice such as move closer, hold still,
  add front lighting or look directly at the camera.
- **Privacy-conscious preview:** test frames are kept only in memory for up to two
  minutes, served with no-store headers and never added to the face gallery.

## 5.0.1 — 2026-08-11

- **Liveness, not animals:** corrects the original requirement interpretation and
  replaces the pets screen with a dedicated anti-spoofing workspace.
- **Local print/screen protection:** a checksum-pinned MiniFAS ONNX model evaluates
  1.5× padded face crops and requires several consecutive live results. Identity is
  blocked on Intercom cameras until liveness is confirmed.
- **Per-camera policy:** choose Required, Advisory or Off. Standard distant cameras
  default to Advisory; Intercom defaults to Required and still requires a second
  factor for door control.
- **Visible evidence:** Activity, event details, Health, MQTT v1 payloads and the
  guided camera test expose liveness state and score. Suspected presentation attacks
  are stored as `spoof_suspected`, never as a recognized person. A camera or model
  failure is separately reported as `liveness_unconfirmed` instead of being falsely
  labelled an attack; Required mode still blocks identity safely.
- **Honest limits:** the UI explicitly states that RGB protection reduces common
  print and screen attacks but does not equal depth/IR certification.

## 5.0.0 — 2026-08-11

- **Friendly user management:** a dedicated everyday Users tab guides creation,
  photo selection, quality feedback, renaming and deletion. The advanced reference
  gallery remains available in the System workspace for expert maintenance.
- **Intercom mode:** configure an entrance camera from a focused screen, preview its
  current Frigate frame, require a larger face, test sharpness/lighting live and keep
  a second factor mandatory for door-control automations. Face recognition alone is
  deliberately never treated as authorization to unlock.
- **Initial animals interpretation:** this was replaced by the intended liveness and
  anti-spoofing workflow in 5.0.1.
- **Upgrade-safe data schema:** first startup creates an automatic pre-migration
  backup, applies idempotent schema migrations and reports the schema in Health.
  Backups now include camera profiles and the access-policy foundation.
- **Future role foundation:** Admin, Operator and Viewer tab policies are present and
  derived from Home Assistant Ingress identity headers. Enforcement stays disabled by
  default in 5.0 while the later user/permission editor is deliberately not exposed.
- **Safer Frigate operation:** the Health report highlights unauthenticated port 5000,
  missing credentials or disabled TLS verification; authenticated port 8971 remains
  the recommended connection.
- **Cache-safe Home Assistant update:** the versioned entry is `ui-5.0.0`, preserving
  the corrected no-leading-slash Ingress behavior introduced in 3.1.4.

## 3.1.4 — 2026-08-10

- **Versioned Ingress path corrected:** the entry no longer starts with `/`.
  Home Assistant already appends it to an Ingress URL ending in `/`; the old
  value produced a double-slash path and FastAPI returned `Not Found`.
- **Fresh document without manual cache clearing:** normal browser sessions open
  the new `ui-3.1.4` document while API requests continue to resolve from the
  stable Ingress root.
- **Regression protection:** release CI rejects a leading slash and verifies the
  exact versioned entry expected by Home Assistant Supervisor.

## 3.1.3 — 2026-08-10

- **Fresh UI in normal Home Assistant sessions:** the add-on opens a new Ingress
  document URL for this release, bypassing the stale iframe document cache that
  did not affect private browsing sessions.
- **Safe versioned entry:** the backend accepts any versioned UI alias, so an
  updated manifest cannot produce the 3.1.1 `Not Found` regression when the
  Supervisor momentarily retains the previous 3.1.2 container image.
- **Release guard:** CI now verifies that the manifest version, Ingress entry,
  backend version and embedded UI version remain synchronized.

## 3.1.2 — 2026-08-10

- **Ingress startup regression fixed:** Home Assistant opens the stable root path
  again, preventing the `{"detail":"Not Found"}` page seen after upgrading to 3.1.1.
- **Upgrade-safe compatibility route:** old versioned UI links are accepted without
  making the Supervisor entry point depend on the exact backend image version.
- **Cache protection retained:** strict no-cache response headers and the UI/backend
  version check continue to prevent stale Home Assistant WebView pages.

## 3.1.1 — 2026-08-10

- **Reliable UI upgrades through Home Assistant Ingress:** each release now opens a
  versioned ingress entry point instead of reusing the same browser document URL.
- **No reusable document validators:** the main UI is served as fresh HTML bytes with
  strict browser and proxy no-cache headers, without `ETag` or `Last-Modified`.
- **Automatic version recovery:** the UI compares its embedded version with the
  running backend and performs one cache-busted reload when they differ.
- **Visible clock and version:** the header shows a live local clock and the version
  reported by the running backend in separate mobile-friendly badges.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-08-10

- **Commercial-grade workspace UI:** daily operations, event investigation and
  system/testing are separated into remembered workspaces with distinct, restrained
  color accents on the granite interface.
- **Clear actions and feedback:** action buttons explain their result, show a busy
  state, prevent repeat clicks and report success or useful failure details.
- **Visual camera studio:** a current Frigate frame, real face-size guide, manual
  face analysis, historical accept/reject preview and an actionable quality funnel
  make per-camera minimum face size understandable and immediately effective.
- **Camera roles and honest visits:** cameras can be marked as observation, entry,
  exit, entry/exit or restricted. Nearby recognition events are grouped into visits
  and routes; arrival/departure is only claimed when the configured camera role
  supports it.
- **Home Assistant visit sensor:** every enrolled person gains a discovered 30-day
  visit sensor, with arrival, departure, duration and common-hour statistics in its
  attributes. Camera profiles are included in operational backups.
- **Responsive UX:** camera tuning, funnels, visits and action controls were tested
  at desktop and phone widths without horizontal overflow.

## 3.0.1 — 2026-08-10

- **Fresh UI after update:** the main document is now served with `no-store`, avoiding
  an older Home Assistant ingress/WebView page hiding the new Advanced recognition tab.
- **Body learning is always reachable:** every activity event now shows the
  body-learning action. When no face/name was suggested, the operator selects an
  existing person first instead of the action silently disappearing.
- **Visible version:** the header reports the running backend version, making a stale
  page or incomplete restart immediately obvious.

## 3.0.0 — 2026-08-10

- **Three evidence paths:** authoritative ArcFace identity, human-reviewed DINOv2
  body appearance with multi-event consensus, and an optional local Vision advisor.
  Body and Vision are advisory and can never establish identity or unlock a door.
- **Guided body learning:** reviewed resident material, confirmed stranger negatives,
  balanced SVM training and repeated stratified calibration reduce false matches.
- **Shared video pipeline:** clips and decoded frames are reused by face, body and
  Vision; configured hardware decode falls back safely and reports what actually ran.
- **12-cell investigation tests:** compare face, body and AI against the exact numbered
  historical frames while preserving clear evidence authority.
- **Stronger Frigate sync:** durable dismissals, retry/failure details, deletion
  awareness, connection diagnostics and serialized changes.
- **Full operational backup:** gallery, reviewed body material/status, audit history, learning
  runs, settings and sync state; credentials, clips and caches stay excluded.
- **Self-checks and responsive UX:** persistent-storage, queue, decoder and model
  health plus a granite advanced screen verified on desktop and mobile. Executable
  classifier files are deliberately rebuilt rather than accepted from an upload.


## 2.1.1 — 2026-08-10

- **Safe upgrades:** existing Home Assistant installations now receive media-cache
  defaults even when their older `options.json` does not yet contain the new 2.1
  fields, preventing a `null` value from blocking add-on startup.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-08-10

- **Learning Center:** a guided, non-destructive gallery coach explains blurry,
  poorly lit and near-duplicate references; bounded Frigate history learning can
  be monitored and cancelled without silently enrolling anyone.
- **Controlled Frigate gallery sync:** operators can preview and explicitly select
  face images to import or export. Imported images are detected and embedded again,
  names are normalized safely, and a durable ledger prevents duplicate transfers.
- **Reliable clips on mobile and ingress:** clips are fetched once into a bounded
  local cache and served with proper HTTP Range support. If an event clip is absent,
  FaceID reconstructs it from Frigate recordings; the UI reports a real absence and
  offers download when a browser cannot decode the MP4.
- **Clear evidence boundaries:** event details visually separate face identity from
  cross-camera appearance hints and optional AI descriptions. Only the face decision
  and operator review can establish identity.
- **Safer calibration:** preliminary tuning and security validation are now distinct.
  The UI shows known/stranger balance and does not imply security-grade evidence
  before 100 independent events including at least 30 of each class.
- **Lower memory use:** recording analysis keeps compressed candidate frames instead
  of retaining many full-resolution 4K arrays in RAM.
- **Mobile activity redesign:** recognition rows become readable event cards, the
  navigation scrollbar is hidden, and the clip player remains above the image modal.

## 2.0.1 — 2026-08-10

- **Correct local-time activity chart:** hourly person statistics now use the
  browser's IANA timezone (including daylight-saving rules) instead of the add-on
  container timezone. Bar direction is isolated from the Hebrew RTL layout, so bar
  length always grows consistently with the displayed count.
- **Mobile clip player:** event clips now open from an explicit play button in a
  second top-layer modal above the event image. Closing pauses playback, removes the
  media source and leaves the event review open underneath.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-27

- **Investigation center:** filter all recognition events by text, person, decision,
  date and time. Open an event to see its face image, explanation, gallery references
  and an inline Frigate clip when the recording still exists.
- **Fast, accountable review:** large correct/other/unknown actions, undo, reviewer
  attribution and append-only review history. HA actions can submit reviews over MQTT.
- **Person profiles:** last location/time, totals, confidence, camera/hour charts,
  verified accuracy, weak events and gallery coaching.
- **System Doctor:** simple seven-day camera quality cards plus Frigate connection
  diagnostics and setup advice.
- **Safer Frigate connection:** authenticated port 8971, TLS verification and automatic
  session renewal are supported and recommended. Port 5000 is compatibility-only.
  Media is proxied so browser clients never receive Frigate credentials.
- **Home Assistant tools:** central MQTT event entity, automation wizard and an
  actionable-notification blueprint with snapshot and review buttons.
- **Calibration, AI and privacy:** day/night cohorts, factual daily summaries, a hard
  rule that AI never decides identity, separate evidence retention, immediate pruning
  and full person-history deletion support.
- **Granite UI:** responsive Hebrew event viewer, profiles, health and privacy screens.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-07-27

- **Visual activity verification:** every Activity event now shows its captured face,
  opens a larger preview on click, and clearly explains when an old Frigate image has
  expired.
- **Durable evidence thumbnails:** new recognition events keep a compact local review
  image for the same retention period as the audit, so calibration labels can be based
  on what was actually seen instead of a name and score alone.
- **Granite theme:** the blue dashboard palette has been replaced with neutral dark
  granite surfaces; green, amber and red are reserved for meaningful status.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-27

- **Friendly Hebrew dashboard:** a new home screen shows real person photos, last seen
  camera/time, today and weekly activity, average confidence and recent recognitions.
- **Simpler workflow:** clear Hebrew navigation, onboarding guidance, a friendlier review
  queue, plain-language activity decisions and advanced thresholds hidden by default.
- **Person statistics:** total, daily, 7/30-day appearances, average confidence, last and
  most frequent camera are calculated from finalized recognition events.
- **Home Assistant person devices:** six MQTT-discovered entities per enrolled person
  expose location, last-seen timestamp, recent presence, daily/total counts and average
  confidence, with richer statistics as attributes.
- **Safer calibration:** processing events cannot be labelled, and FaceID no longer shows
  an invented recommendation before real labelled evidence exists.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-27

- **Recorded-clip evidence:** finished events are sampled across diverse frames, all
  faces are quality-scored, and the relevant face track is selected before consensus.
- **Hardware backends:** automatic CPU, CUDA or OpenVINO provider selection with
  provider details in the health endpoint.
- **Durable processing:** snapshot and clip jobs survive restarts and retry safely.
- **Measured calibration:** Activity labels complete events and reports TAR/FAR/FRR
  globally, by camera and by person, with target-FAR-safe threshold recommendations.
- **Cross-camera scenarios:** visits require a confirmed identity or short-lived
  appearance hint. Appearance Re-ID never becomes a face identity verdict.
- **Automation API v1:** stable MQTT event/scenario payloads, Home Assistant device
  triggers, optional asynchronous webhooks and cooldown.
- **Optional local AI context:** Ollama-compatible descriptions, tags and semantic
  Activity search. AI is explicitly barred from identifying people.
- **New Activity and Calibration UI** with evidence, scenarios and ground-truth labels.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-27

- **Multi-frame decisions:** a person is published only after distinct frames agree.
- **Open-set safety:** recognition and ignore decisions require a configurable lead over
  the runner-up; `unknown_threshold` now creates a real unknown/ambiguous boundary.
- **Persistent audit:** SQLite records event verdicts and the evidence behind them, with
  configurable retention and a read-only `/api/audit` endpoint.
- **Safer integration:** Frigate write-back is opt-in by default and also applies to
  manual assignment/backfill paths.
- **Durability and privacy:** gallery metadata uses atomic replacement, nested person
  deletion is safe, and the web server exposes only JPEG media instead of all of `data/`.
- Dependency versions are pinned and decision/audit/gallery regression tests run in CI.

## 0.6.13 — 2026-07-26

- **Log messages are English now.** README, UI, docs and changelog were English while the
  service logged in German — so anyone reporting a problem had to translate their own log
  first, and the diagnostic lines added in 0.6.10–0.6.12 were unreadable for most of the
  people they were written for. All user-facing log output is now English. (Code comments
  stay German; they are for whoever edits the source, not for whoever runs it.)

## 0.6.12 — 2026-07-26

- **"No face found" now says which kind.** The log distinguishes *a face was detected but
  it is too small* (reporting its pixel width, the `min_face_px` limit and the snapshot
  dimensions) from *no face at all* — two very different problems. Too small points at
  Frigate's `snapshots.height` or camera distance; none at all points at viewing angle or
  light. Previously both produced the same line, leaving nowhere to start.

## 0.6.11 — 2026-07-26

- **New LOG tab.** The service log is now visible in the web UI — the last 500 lines,
  refreshing every 5 seconds, with a warnings-only filter and a copy button for pasting
  into a bug report. Home Assistant app users had the app's log tab; standalone and
  container users had to reach for `journalctl` or `docker logs`, which is exactly the
  wrong moment to switch to a terminal when you are trying to find out why nothing is
  being recognised. Noise from the inference library is filtered out.

## 0.6.10 — 2026-07-26

- **Fixed: polled events could be processed twice.** The finalizer clears an event from
  memory once it is done, so the poller then saw a fully processed MQTT event as new and
  ran it again — while logging the untruth "never announced by MQTT". It now remembers
  the last 1000 event ids it handled.
- **The log no longer goes silent when nothing is recognised.** Events without a usable
  face are the normal case (back to camera, too far away), but they were dropped without
  a word — making a healthy install look identical to a broken one. Both "no snapshot"
  and "no face >= min_face_px" are now logged. Measured here: over 19 hours, 17 of 20
  events held no face at all, and the log said nothing about any of them.

## 0.6.9 — 2026-07-26

- **Fixed: no Home Assistant entities unless you listed your cameras.** An empty
  `cameras` list means "process every camera" — but MQTT discovery looped over exactly
  that empty list, so it announced nothing. Anyone running the default configuration got
  no sensors at all. FaceID now asks Frigate for the camera list when none is configured,
  and additionally announces a camera the first time it sees an event from it. Reported
  in the community thread; it never showed up here because our own config lists cameras
  explicitly.
- **New: `frigate_topic_prefix`** (default `frigate`). The subscription was hard-coded,
  so a Frigate instance with a custom `mqtt.topic_prefix` was silently never heard.
- **Startup now says whether Frigate is reachable**, lists its cameras, and warns about
  configured cameras that do not exist there. "It recognises nothing" and "nothing ever
  arrives" were indistinguishable in the log before.

## 0.6.8 — 2026-07-25

- **Hotfix: the web UI stayed blank after 0.6.6.** The new "photos averaged per match"
  field declared a `const tk` that already existed for the set-aside limit — a
  `SyntaxError` that stops the entire script from loading, so the whole page died, not
  just Settings. CI now runs `node --check` over the inline script, so a broken UI can
  no longer be released.
- **Fixed: the header showed `queue 0` while faces were waiting.** It reported the size
  of the internal processing queue, not the review queue. The review count is now what
  it says it is; the internal one moved to `processing`.

## 0.6.7 — 2026-07-25

- **New: `poll_interval`** — optionally also poll Frigate's event API instead of relying
  on MQTT alone. Events created through Frigate's API are not tracked objects and never
  appear on `frigate/events`, so FaceID never saw them. A common case is a camera's own
  person detection wired up as a reliability bridge: on one installation that was ~22
  events per day at the front door, of which 12 in 20 held a usable face — roughly
  doubling the events FaceID could learn from. Off by default; 30 seconds is sensible.
- Polled events run through the same pipeline. They carry no bounding box, so their
  snapshot is the full frame rather than a person crop — face detection copes, and the
  clip path (sharper reference photos) applies as usual.

## 0.6.6 — 2026-07-25

- **`match_top_k` is now adjustable in Settings** ("Photos averaged per match"). It was
  config-file only, yet it turns out to be the single biggest lever on recognition — and
  the sensible value depends on your gallery.
- Measured on a real 128-photo gallery (leave-one-out, so with ground truth), lowering it
  from 3 to 1 nearly doubled correct recognitions (36 → 65) with **zero** misassignments,
  and *widened* the margin to the runner-up. The reason: the score averages the k best
  matching photos, so a person whose references cover many different angles gets dragged
  down by her own less similar photos — punishing exactly the well-covered people.
- The practical probe now excludes **self-hits**: an event whose face is already in the
  gallery scores ~1.0 and measures nothing. It flattered small k badly — after excluding
  them on a k-independent basis (highest single similarity, not the k-mean), the honest
  comparison on one identical test set is 90% / 93% / 100% recognised for k = 3 / 2 / 1.
- The imbalance concern behind top-k was checked, not assumed: strangers (ignore anchors)
  peaked at 0.19 against a 0.50 threshold at every k, and no wrong person ever crossed
  the threshold. Measure your own with `scripts/measure-recognition.py` before changing.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-07-25

- **Reference photos now remember where they came from.** Assigning a face used to keep
  only the crop and the embedding, throwing away camera and event time — so it was
  impossible to tell whether somebody was enrolled from one camera only. `meta.json`
  now carries a `sources` entry per photo (existing photos stay as they are, marked
  unknown).
- **coverage.py reports camera spread** and flags "only ever seen at one camera", which
  matters more than photo count: a different camera means a different angle, height and
  light.
- **Fixed a misleading warning.** "No night shot" was reported for every person, but
  where motion-triggered lights switch on, the camera records in colour at night and no
  IR frame ever exists. Missing IR shots are now only flagged for cameras that actually
  produce greyscale, derived from the gallery instead of assumed.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-07-25

- **New: `scripts/coverage.py`** — per person, how well is she actually covered and what
  is missing? Reports photo count, diversity (mean pairwise similarity), viewing angles
  estimated from the landmarks (frontal / half / profile), day vs night/IR shots, and a
  leave-one-out self test — then names the concrete gap ("no frontal shot", "no night
  shot", "too few photos").
- **New: `scripts/measure-recognition.py`** — did enrolling actually help? Compares the
  current gallery against an older one (an unpacked backup) via leave-one-out, plus a
  practical probe against recent Frigate events.
- The self test is deliberately harsh and pessimistic on small galleries — with five
  varied photos, each has to hold up against four entirely different situations. It is
  only reported as a defect from eight photos up, and a low value means "these photos
  reinforce each other weakly", not "this person is not recognised in practice".

## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-25

- **Fixed: review cards showed the wrong date.** A face was stamped with the moment
  FaceID processed it, not the moment it happened — so a history scan over four weeks
  labelled every card with today's date. Cards now carry the Frigate event time and the
  UI prefers it. Existing cards can be repaired with
  `python scripts/backfill-event-ts.py` (pulls the real time via the stored event ID).

## 0.6.2 — 2026-07-25

- **History scan can recover missed events** (`python -m app.backfill --rescue`). When the
  detect snapshot holds no usable face, the event clip is scanned instead — measured over
  180 events, about one in five yields a face that the normal scan misses entirely.
- **Quality gate calibrated against real data, not intuition.** A first run put 308 faces
  into the review queue, most of them useless: back-of-head shots, motion blur, and
  outright false positives (a church spire scored 0.57). Sorting 74 finds by detection
  score showed a clean split — below ~0.8 it is mostly junk, above it mostly real faces.
  Rescue therefore requires **0.85** by default (`--rescue-min-det`), which cuts the yield
  to roughly a seventh and leaves the usable finds.
- Deliberately **no** filter on gallery match score: a stranger's face scores low by
  definition, and enrolling strangers is what the queue is for. Also no pose filter —
  measurement showed working galleries are full of profile shots (median frontality 0.55),
  so filtering those would discard good references.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-25

- **Sharper reference photos now actually land.** 0.6.0 sampled a handful of timestamps
  from the recording and hoped one of them held the face — on real events that worked
  only about one time in six, because Frigate picks its snapshot from a moment we cannot
  know. FaceID now pulls the event clip once and scans frames across it instead: same
  ~2x larger faces, but four times as often (measured 4/6 vs 1/6 on the same events).
- **Fixed: the wrong face could veto a good frame.** With several people in view, only
  the *largest* face in a frame was compared against the original — if that was somebody
  else, the whole frame was discarded even though the right person was in it. All faces
  in a frame are now checked and the best identity match wins.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-23

- **Sharper reference photos (new default)**: faces entering the review queue — live and
  via the history scan — are now re-fetched from Frigate's *recording* instead of the
  downscaled detect stream. Across a dozen real events faces came out about twice as
  large (84px → 178px), which means better recognition and far clearer separation between
  real duplicates and same-person-other-angle. Candidate frames are sampled across the
  event and each must match the original face, so with several people in frame the wrong
  one cannot be enrolled. Live recognition keeps using the fast snapshot path. Toggle:
  **Settings → Sharper reference photos** (`hires_enroll`).

## 0.5.6 — 2026-07-23

- **Honest hover highlight.** Hovering a set-aside photo used to outline its three closest
  matches in green and claim they were duplicates — misleading, since a photo removed for
  the photo limit is merely similar (same person, other angle), not a duplicate. Now the
  photo it actually duplicates is outlined bright green, merely-similar photos get a grey
  outline, and **every marked photo shows its similarity %** so you can tell the two
  apart. The tooltip text matches the real reason it was set aside.

## 0.5.5 — 2026-07-23

- Hotfix: a broken code path made /api/persons return 500 right after 0.5.4 (the
  set-aside partner was referenced before being read). Person list works again.

## 0.5.4 — 2026-07-23

- **Detects true duplicate images**, not just similar faces: a perceptual-hash pass now
  finds photos whose *image* is identical to another one (e.g. the same crop stored
  twice). These could never be caught by face-similarity — for the model they look like
  two different faces — which is why visibly identical tiles survived earlier passes.
- **Fixed the hover highlight on set-aside photos**: it now always highlights the photos
  it was considered a duplicate of (the exact partner is recorded when trimming, plus the
  closest matches), instead of silently showing nothing when similarity fell below a fixed
  threshold.

## 0.5.3 — 2026-07-23

- Hover-highlight on set-aside photos now uses the same sensitivity as duplicate removal,
  so hovering a trimmed photo highlights only its genuine near-duplicates — not every
  same-person photo. Previously the 0.45 highlight lit up most of a person's gallery on
  noisy camera crops, making everything look like a duplicate.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-07-23

- **Duplicate removal now works on camera data**: small low-res crops make even
  near-identical faces score only ~0.66 similar (a phone photo would be 0.95+), so the
  old 0.75 floor never triggered. The sensitivity range is now 0.50–0.95 (default 0.65)
  with a **live preview** of how many photos would be set aside as you adjust it.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-07-23

- **Remove duplicates** (Settings): scans all persons and sets aside photos that are
  near-identical to one you already have — they add nothing to recognition. Adjustable
  duplicate sensitivity; the more redundant of each pair is moved (restorable). Diversity
  is what makes recognition robust, not photo count. Fixed lingering 'add-on' wording in
  the UI (Home Assistant calls them apps).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-23

- **Set-aside photos no longer grow unbounded**: FaceID now keeps only the most recent
  `trimmed_keep` trimmed photos per person (default 10, adjustable in Settings) and
  deletes older ones, plus a **clear all** button per person. Recognizing a face live
  never adds to the gallery — only manual assign/upload does — so day-to-day use costs
  no extra storage. See docs/trimming.md.

## 0.4.9 — 2026-07-23

- Hovering a set-aside (trimmed) photo now highlights the active reference photos it is
  most similar to — so you can see at a glance which photos it was considered a duplicate
  of.

## 0.4.8 — 2026-07-23

- Added a dedicated **docs/trimming.md** explaining the photo-limit behaviour in depth
  (why, the exact most-redundant selection rule with numbers, restore/curate workflow),
  linked from a "Learn more" link in the set-aside section and from the README.

## 0.4.7 — 2026-07-23

- Trimmed (set-aside) photos are now clearly distinguished: shown desaturated and dimmed
  under a "SET ASIDE" label, and full-colour on hover, so they read as archived rather
  than active reference photos.

## 0.4.6 — 2026-07-23

- Clearer Settings: the save button is now "SAVE SETTINGS" (it saves the thresholds and
  the photo limit together) — the photo-limit field only applies when you press it.

## 0.4.5 — 2026-07-23

- **Adjustable photo cap in Settings** (`max_faces_per_person`): lowering it trims every
  person down to the new limit immediately (most-redundant photos set aside, restorable),
  so the trimming behaviour is easy to see and control. Documented in the README.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-07-23

- **Transparent photo trimming**: when a person exceeds the photo limit, the removed
  reference is no longer silently deleted — it is set aside and shown on the person card
  with a short reason (most similar to the rest, so diverse angles are kept), plus
  one-click **restore** or delete. The eviction already preferred redundant over unique
  photos; now you can see and undo it.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-07-23

- **Self-healing gallery**: on startup, persons whose reference filenames collided in
  pre-0.2.1 data (duplicate names, embedding/image count mismatch) are repaired
  automatically — filenames become unique and 1:1 with embeddings, so backups and the
  UI stay consistent. Recognition data is never touched.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-07-23

- Fix: the Download-Backup link and file-upload labels now match the button styling
  (the .act/.ghost styles only applied to <button> before).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-23

- **New Settings tab** — matching thresholds (recognition, unknown, suggestion, cluster,
  ignore) are now live-editable sliders, and backup/restore lives here instead of on the
  Persons tab. Edits are stored in `data/settings.json` and override config / app
  options, so they persist across restarts and updates.
- **Built-in daily auto-backup** (optional): enable it, choose the hour and how many to
  keep — runs inside FaceID, no external cron needed. App options and a documented
  host-cron / HA-automation alternative included.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-23

- **Backup & restore**: download your whole gallery (persons + ignore anchors) as a
  `.tar.gz` from the Persons tab, and restore it later — either **replace** everything
  or **merge** in only what's missing. Path-traversal-safe. Your face data is the one
  irreplaceable thing here, so now it's one click to safeguard.
- **Removed the Recognitions tab** — it was an in-memory, since-restart-only list that
  never persisted; Frigate's Explore (with the names FaceID writes back) covers "who
  was seen when" far better.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-23

- **Configurable suggestion threshold** (`suggest_threshold`, default 0.40): controls
  when an unknown face is grouped into a "Looks like <person>" suggestion. Available as
  an app option too.
- **Jump-to-person dropdown** on the Persons tab (shown once you have more than a few
  people) — pick a name to scroll straight to that person.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-07-23

- **Smarter review queue**: unknown faces that resemble an enrolled person are now
  grouped into one **"Looks like <name>"** card with a single **ASSIGN ALL** button —
  no more assigning the same person cluster by cluster. The person dropdown is
  pre-selected to the suggestion, and each face has a ✗ **"not this person"** button to
  pull it out if it doesn't belong. Remaining unrecognized clusters keep their own
  dropdown, pre-selected to the best guess.
- **Grouped person dropdowns**: every person picker is now split into ★ Favorites and
  Others, alphabetically sorted.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-23

- **Favorites & sorted person list**: mark people as favorites with the ★ button on
  their card. The Persons tab now groups into **Favorites** and **Others**, each sorted
  alphabetically — so the household members you care about stay at the top.

## 0.2.9 — 2026-07-23

- **Fix: tab content race** — switching tabs while a fetch was still in flight
  could let the finishing request overwrite the newly opened tab (e.g. freshly
  detected unknown faces appeared under the Ignored tab). Each view now only
  renders if its tab is still active.

## 0.2.8 — 2026-07-22

- **Fix: fresh installs and updates crashed on start** (`ImportError:
  find_face_padded`) — a helper in `engine.py` (padded retry for close-up portrait
  detection, used by photo upload and CLI enrollment) was missing from the published
  sources. Thanks @KoenvanH for the report (#1). The release process now runs an
  import-consistency check so this class of error can't ship again.

## 0.2.7 — 2026-07-22

- Release an ignored group directly into a **new** person: the Ignored tab got the
  same "…or new name" field the unknown queue has.

## 0.2.6 — 2026-07-22

- Tooltips on every button, icon and control — tab navigation, cluster actions,
  ignore-group curation, backfill and person management all explain themselves
  on hover now.

## 0.2.5 — 2026-07-22

- **Curatable ignore groups**: anchors now carry a persistent group (existing anchors
  are migrated automatically). You can merge groups, move selected anchors between
  groups, and assign wrongly ignored faces directly to a real person — auto-learned
  anchors join the group of their best-matching anchor, so groups converge on real
  identities over time. Select tiles for partial actions, or apply to a whole group.

## 0.2.4 — 2026-07-22

- **Ignored tab groups anchors by person** (same clustering as the unknown queue),
  with per-group actions: restore a whole group to review or delete it. Groups show
  auto-learned counts and the original person name for "ignore person" entries.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-07-22

- **Ignore anchors now learn**: when an ignored person reappears with a changed look,
  the new appearance is added as an additional anchor automatically — so they stop
  resurfacing in the unknown queue over time. Guardrails: only on unambiguous matches
  (similarity ≥ ignore_threshold + 0.1 AND a clear margin over every enrolled person),
  near-duplicate anchors are skipped, and auto-learned anchors are visibly marked
  "auto" in the Ignored tab (delete anytime). Disable with ignore_learning: false.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-07-22

- Ignored faces now live in their own **IGNORED tab** instead of a section at the
  bottom of the Unknown tab.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-07-22

- **"Ignore person" button** on person cards: stop tracking an enrolled person in one
  click — all their reference faces become ignore anchors (reversible via the Ignored
  section). No more manual unassign-then-ignore round trips.
- Fix: reference filenames could collide when many faces were added within the same
  millisecond (bulk uploads), silently overwriting each other.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-22

- **Ignore list**: the "ignore" action on unknown faces now keeps the face as a
  negative anchor — an ignored person is never notified, never matched to a known
  person and never resurfaces in the review queue. No more dummy persons for people
  you simply don't want to track. Manage them in the new "Ignored" section
  (restore to review or delete). "Discard" remains for garbage crops.
- **Fairer matching**: person score is now the mean of the top-k (default 3) most
  similar reference images instead of the single best one — a person with many
  photos no longer wins borderline matches on a lucky outlier. Note: absolute
  scores drop slightly; if known people start landing in review, lower
  `match_threshold` a notch.
- **Per-person photo cap** (default 40): adding more drops the most redundant
  reference, keeping galleries balanced.
- New config options: `match_top_k`, `max_faces_per_person`, `ignore_threshold`.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-07-22

Initial public release.

- Face recognition for Frigate person events (InsightFace `buffalo_l`:
  SCRFD detection + ArcFace embeddings, CPU-only)
- Review UI: auto-clustered unknown faces (DBSCAN), one-click assignment,
  bulk "apply suggestions", full-snapshot lightbox, move faces back to review
- One-click camera history scan (backfill) with live progress
- Photo upload and CLI folder enrollment; robust detection for close-up portraits
- Frigate write-back: `sub_label` on live recognitions, retroactively via the
  history scan, and when assigning a face in the review UI
- Home Assistant: MQTT discovery sensors per camera with presence window
  (`Alice, Bob` → `nobody`), `faceid/event` topic for automations
  (exactly one message per Frigate event and person)
- Configurable MQTT topic prefix/client id for multi-instance setups
- Optional HTTP Basic Auth for standalone installs (app uses HA ingress)
- Home Assistant app (amd64/aarch64, ingress, AVX pre-flight check)
